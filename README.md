PolyVision – Plastic Waste Classification Using AI
National University of Singapore
Under the guidance of Prof. Tan Wee Kek

This project presents an AI-powered image classification tool designed to automatically identify different types of plastic waste — such as HDPE, LDPE, PVC, and more — from visual input. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning techniques, the tool aims to facilitate efficient waste sorting, enabling smarter recycling and waste management systems.

Developed as part of a collaborative student project at NUS, this solution contributes toward sustainable environmental practices using AI.
